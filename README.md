# MOFOSPLOIT

I have changed and created a lot of files. To see the diff, please look at previously mentioned repo and this repo using the diff tool. (License requires me to say this)

## REQUIREMENTS
python3.6
All other dependencies are outlined in requirements.txt.

## Getting Started

Please refer to https://github.com/13o-bbr-bbq/machine_learning_security/tree/master/DeepExploit for information on how to get started. The code in the repo was jumbled up so I tried to clean it up. 
This is my attempt to turn DeepExploit into a framework where the ML algorithms act as plug-and-play modules.
