# MOFOSPLOIT

An attempt at a framework to automate metasploit by making the machine learning module as plug and play. Alpha software and still developing. 
Essentially a fork of Deep Exploit at https://github.com/13o-bbr-bbq/machine_learning_security/tree/master/DeepExploit

## Getting Started

Please refer to https://github.com/13o-bbr-bbq/machine_learning_security/tree/master/DeepExploit for information on how to get started. The code in the repo was jumbled up so I tried to clean it up. 
This is my attempt to turn DeepExploit into a framework where the ML algorithms act as plug-and-play modules.
